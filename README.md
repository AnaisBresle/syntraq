# Project Scope

This is a multiple-page site. 
The purpose of the site is to gauge people's interest in new software. 
While the B2B software can serve different teams across the companies, three key personas have been identified as either the main target, key users, or most likely first users. 

The site needs to be responsive. 
The CTA is to join a mailing list to be among the first to hear about the product, as well as have the opportunity to contribute to its development. 

## Contraints

The client is not sure of its branding yet - so need to be able to test colour schemes.
